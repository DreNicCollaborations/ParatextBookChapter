####Tracing cooperative work through scholarly paratexts, a pilot study of Bioinformatics

#####Abstract
Information science has traditionally looked at the journal article as an artifact of scholarly work, using elements like authorship, or citation lists to trace meaningful connections between idnividuals, locales or subjects. Here, we build off of previous works that have used acknowledgment statements as a way of understanding the collaborative nature of software development in cooperative work settings. We discuss implications for the study of cooperative work more generally, and provide some preliminary results from a pilot study of bioinformatics as an exemplar of the software-intensive engineering discipline. 

#####Introduction
Our aim here is to bring an information science tradition of scientometrics to the study of 
cooperative work. We are particular interested in traces and evidence of cooperative work that can be mined from publications from domains where software and information systems are developed, as well as workplace settings where traditional science questions are approached by groups that collaborate using cyberinfrastructures. 

#####Background
The field of computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) is concerned largely with the way that people design, build, use and manipulate technologies to achieve a shared task or desired outcome. These studies are often aimed at understanding how the emergent properties of a collaborative technology effect collaboration (), or how the design of a particular application can be of used to ease the burden of working at different times, or in different geographical places  (). Methodological approaches to studying cooperative work tend to be of two very distinct flavors: 1. qualitative, field based observations and 2. quantitative data analysis of either a technology or a group's task-based performance. 

The more informal qualitative approach is an in-situ study. This type of scholarship often relies on ethnographic or contextual inquiry methods which allow the researcher, through narrative reconstruction, to reflect upon the practices of a technology and it's users "as it happens". Implying that these methods capture the dynamics of a workplace that are rapidly and dynamically changing.

Conversely, the more formal quantitative methods of CSCW use an ex-situ approach. oftentimes these take on a flavor of post-hoc analysis by assembling traces of a user's activities or communications from a collaborative system in order to either critique an existing design and suggest improvements, or to demonstrate the effects of some sort or design-based intervention for inducing more favorable behaviors ( a recent example is Mueller, 2012). 

Information science has much to offer the field of CSCW, including its rich history of metric based analysis of collaboration, co-production (authorship, bibliographic coupling, etc) and network analysis. However, CSCW rarely considers scholarly publications, or formally published literature as a data source for investigating cooperative work. There are a number of reasons for this omission; the publication of research article are slow, citations take many years to accumulate and can't be relied upon for design interventions; journal articles and books tend to be authored by a few elite members of a research group that cite other elite members- in order to understand a technology in use, or a potential improvement of a collaborative arrangement it is often necessary to study those that are not a part of this elite class of authors, and are often invisible to such rationalized models of authorship (Suchman, 2007).

These are all relevant critiques and limitations of using publications, and formal scholarly products as a data source for CSCW study. Here, we suggest a way to use scientometric techniques as a methodological bridge between the quantitative and qualitative divide of CSCW research. We believe there is much to be gained by more informed in-situ studies, and quick and dirty ex-situ - and that

 can be a fruitful way to study cooperative work from an information science purview. As has been observed, and studied by others () there is a tradition in some scientific cultures of acknowledging the contribution of others in the effort, analysis, or general ideas 

We propose that these are traces of cooperative work that extend the reach of scholarly network, not just in terms of formal authorship, but as a hit-tip or
